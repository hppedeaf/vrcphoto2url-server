## 🎮 **VRChat Workflow**

### **Typical VRChat Screenshot Process:**
1. **📸 User takes screenshot in VRChat** 
   - Creates large file (3840x2160, 5-10MB)
   - VRChat writes file to Screenshots folder

2. **🔍 System detects file creation**
   - PhotoMonitorHandler triggers with 5-second delay
   - Allows VRChat to fully write large file

3. **🔄 VRCX renames file (if installed)**
   - System detects via `on_moved()` event
   - Updates file path tracking automatically

4. **✅ File stability verification**
   - 3 consecutive size checks ensure file is complete
   - Advanced stability checking prevents corrupt uploads

5. **🚀 Upload processing**
   - AutoUploadWorker with 15 retry attempts
   - Progressive backoff timing for reliability
   - Automatic image optimization and quality settings

6. **🎯 Success notification**
   - User receives permanent URL for sharing
   - File preserved on server with metadata
