### Technical Details

#### Updated Dependencies
**Server (requirements.txt)**:
- fastapi>=0.115.0 (updated from 0.104.1)
- uvicorn[standard]>=0.32.0 (updated from 0.24.0)
- python-multipart>=0.0.12 (updated)
- pydantic>=2.10.0 (updated for Python 3.13 compatibility)
- Pillow>=10.4.0 (updated for Python 3.13 compatibility)
- All other dependencies updated to latest compatible versions

**Client (requirements.txt)**:
- PySide6>=6.5.0 (already compatible)
- All dependencies working correctly

#### Architecture Validation
- âœ… Server: Independent FastAPI application ready for Railway deployment
- âœ… Client: Standalone PySide6 GUI application for end users
- âœ… Communication: RESTful API with proper authentication
- âœ… Separation: Complete isolation between server and client codebases

### Deployment Readiness

#### Server (Railway.com Ready)
- âœ… Procfile configured
- âœ… railway.json configured
- âœ… Environment variables documented
- âœ… Dependencies updated and tested
- âœ… FastAPI production-ready

#### Client (End User Ready)
- âœ… Modern PySide6 GUI
- âœ… Connection testing capability
- âœ… File management interface
- âœ… All dependencies installable via pip

### Next Steps
1. **Production Deployment**: Deploy server to Railway.com
2. **Client Distribution**: Package client for end users
3. **Documentation**: Finalize user guides
4. **Testing**: Test with production server URL

### Conclusion
ðŸŽ¯ **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**: The custom server file manager has been successfully separated into distinct server and client applications. Both applications are running live, communicating correctly, and ready for production deployment.

**Key Achievements**:
- âœ… Complete Flask â†’ FastAPI migration
- âœ… Python 3.13 compatibility achieved
- âœ… All dependency conflicts resolved
- âœ… Live integration testing successful
- âœ… Railway deployment configuration complete
- âœ… Modern client GUI implemented
- âœ… Authentication and security working
- âœ… File operations fully functional

The separated architecture is now production-ready and meets all project requirements.
