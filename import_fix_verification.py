VRCPhoto2URL Import Fix Verification Test

This script tests that all import issues have been resolved for both:
1. Your friend's issue: ImportError with relative imports
2. Your issue: Executable not launching due to import problems

Both the Python source and the rebuilt executable should work correctly.
