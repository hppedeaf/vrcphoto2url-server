üß™ VRCPhoto2URL Responsive Design Manual Test Guide
==================================================

1. INITIAL SETUP
   - Open browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000/admin
   - Verify the admin interface loads properly
   - Check that sidebar and main content are visible

2. WINDOW RESIZING TEST
   a) Desktop to Tablet:
      - Resize browser window from full size to ~768px width
      - Sidebar should remain visible but may change size
      - Main content should adjust to fill remaining space
      - No horizontal scrollbars should appear

   b) Tablet to Mobile:
      - Resize window to ~480px width or less
      - Sidebar should convert to mobile overlay mode
      - Main content should use full width
      - Sidebar toggle button should be visible

3. WINDOW MAXIMIZING TEST
   a) From Normal Window:
      - Start with a normal-sized browser window
      - Click maximize button or press F11
      - Layout should smoothly expand to fill screen
      - Sidebar should maintain proportional width
      - Files grid should utilize extra space

   b) From Maximized Window:
      - Start with maximized window
      - Restore to normal size
      - Layout should smoothly contract
      - No content should be cut off

4. SIDEBAR FUNCTIONALITY TEST
   a) Desktop Mode:
      - Click sidebar toggle button
      - Sidebar should collapse/expand smoothly
      - Main content should adjust accordingly
      - No layout jumps should occur

   b) Mobile Mode:
      - On mobile/narrow layout, click toggle
      - Sidebar should slide in from left
      - Dark overlay should appear behind sidebar
      - Clicking overlay should close sidebar

5. GRID RESPONSIVENESS TEST
   a) Navigate to Files tab
   b) Resize window while observing files grid
   c) Grid columns should adjust based on width:
      - Very narrow: 2 columns
      - Medium: 3-4 columns  
      - Wide: 5-6 columns
      - Ultra-wide: 6+ columns

6. CONTENT OVERFLOW TEST
   a) Ensure no horizontal scrolling in main content
   b) All modals should fit within viewport
   c) Long filenames should wrap or truncate properly
   d) Tables should be responsive on mobile

EXPECTED RESULTS:
‚úÖ Smooth transitions during all resize operations
‚úÖ No horizontal scrollbars in main content area
‚úÖ Proper mobile layout activation below 768px
‚úÖ Sidebar toggle works in both desktop and mobile modes
‚úÖ Files grid adapts column count based on available width
‚úÖ Window maximizing utilizes full screen space efficiently
‚úÖ All content remains accessible across different sizes

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If layout appears broken, refresh the page
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure server is running latest version with fixes
- Test in different browsers for compatibility
